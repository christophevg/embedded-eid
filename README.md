# Embedded eID
An experiment to implement a minimalistic embedded library to read (Belgian) eID smart cards.

## Introduction

This repository holds all information, designs and software collected while investigating the possibility to access a (Belgian) eID smart card from an embedded system, e.g. an Arduino,...

This means we don't have access to a full-blown card-reader, like [ACR38U](http://www.acs.com.hk/en/products/199/acr38u-i1-smart-card-reader/) or the likes, nor a PC or Mac to run some bloated Java-based middleware/runtime/... on top of some OS-based smart card driver infrastructure and so on.

The fact that it took me more than a few hours to find some basic protocol information on how to access it, proves the bad state of affaires. Soon, I hope, this repository will show that it doesn't have to be this way, and that accessing (Belgian) eID smart cards is simple and can be done in a fully transparant way. We'll see ;-)

To be continued...
